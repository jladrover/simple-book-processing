    "So for the first book (Moby Dick), we want to loop line by line in the novel where each line is converted to a temporary list of words separated by spaces. A dictionary of english singular pronouns is thus created with the pronouns being keys and their counts as values (initially zero). Looping through each lowercase word in the wordlist, if a list element is in the key, then it is matched with the key of the dictionary and its value is incremented by 1. This process is continued until the end of the file and we output the dictionary for analysis. We see that 'it', possibly referring to Moby Dick in the novel, is the most commonly used singular pronoun, with 'i' and 'he' coming in second and third respectively."
